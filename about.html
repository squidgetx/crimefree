          <p>“Segregation is not historical. It happens everyday.” </p>
          <p>Inspired by Dr. Deborah Archer’s research, our project attempts to reveal the untold stories of housing segregation happening “legally” in the present day - as known as ‘crime free housing ordinances’. </p>
          <p>Crime free housing ordinances are local laws that encourage or require landlords to evict or exclude tenants who have contact with the criminal legal system. While these laws are formally race neutral, they lead to discriminatory outcomes. These laws are illegal under the Fair Housing Act of 1968. But this does not automatically mean they will be challenged and repealed. </p>
          <p>Drawing the redlining map, eviction, and census data happening across the United States, our project demonstrates the inequality underneath the map.We hope to spread awareness of these practices and put pressure on our communities.</p>
